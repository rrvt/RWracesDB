<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The purpose of RacesDB is to augment the San Jose Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES) database 
operations.  Using this c++ application to access the data in the database various reports may be generated
to meet the needs of the organization.  These reports often take the form of a comma separated value (csv) file
which is then read into other applications.  The are described more fully in the 
<a href="Operations.htm">operations page.</a>.  
</p>
<p>
In addition to the reports a status csv file is read into the
application and subsequently uploaded to the database.  The status file contains information about the
participation of individuals and whether they have completed the training required for earning an ID badge.  The
status csv file is generated from an online (Google) spreadsheet that is maintained by other individuals in the
organization.
</p>
<p>
The program is not static as it changes with the needs of the organization.  Surveys and questionnaires have
been produced by the program that have been customized with an individual's information.  At the time of this
writing those functions have been removed as they seem to be non-relevant during the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
This program is not very polished as it has been written and updated with specific needs in mind.
